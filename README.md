# Jumpy Star

A happy, family oriented little platformer.

Bugfix:

Better coding:

	- Use templates to do the filters below distance.

Do better:

	- When the player high jumps, the distance of the world moves with it.
	- World generation (perhaps branching paths?... Think about it on paper first...)
	- Tweaks to the engine so two states can be rendered at once (for example, render the game and on top of it, render the menu).
	- More than one bonus per platform.
	- More than one enemy per platform.

Features:
	- More score should be given for enemies trapped without stunning them.
	- Day - Night cycle for the background: starts at midday, ends at night.
	- More enemy types:
		- Patrolling with pauses.
		- Patrolling horizontal shooter.
		- Flying, descending after the player.
		- Patrolling, no jumping on.
		- Flying, stops and shoots directly at the player.
		- Descending from a side of the screen, shooting nasty patterns.
		- Cannon... Shoots at the player directly in an angle and stuff.
		- We need more variety here. Think a while...
		
	- Scoring bonus with different points.
	- Specials: We need more regular specials so there's a point to the best of them.

		- More stuff, maybe?

	- Game speed: do no make it faster as it's done now.
	- Add bonus random chance.
	- Add score markers (each thing you pick up makes a score decoration appear).
	- Platform types:
		- Bouncy platforms.
		- Completely solid platforms (except for high jump).
		- Moving platforms (no spawns), horizontal and... vertical?. Maybe even circular motions?
			- Would involve platform "latching" for the player, with the risk of these latches being deleted.
		- Other fun features (friction).
