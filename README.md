# Jumpy Star

Roadmap:
	- Check triple jump special, see if you can pick it and jump.
	- Speed special, do it gradually.
	- Add pause.
	- Fix special stacking (or at least, check it).
	- Add bonus random chance.
	- Add score markers.
	- Do not shoot from outside screen (or rather, do no add projectiles outside the camera box...).
		- This keeps failing.

Review:
	- Fix bug in which stunned enemies are harmful.
